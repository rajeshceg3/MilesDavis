    subtitle: "East St. Louis, 1944",
    content: "The trumpet was not yet a voice. It was an object of brass and spit, cold in the hands. The air in East St. Louis hung heavy with industrial soot and the distant, rhythmic clatter of the river. He learned to listen before he learned to speak. To the space between notes. To the silence that makes the sound possible.",

    subtitle: "New York, 52nd Street",
    content: "He arrived in the city like a knife looking for an edge. Parker was the storm, Dizzy was the sun, but Miles sought the shadows. He didn't play faster; he played less. He found the notes that others discarded and polished them until they cut. A new cool. A detached intensity that burned colder than fire.",

    subtitle: "The Church, 1959",
    content: "Modality. A stripping away of the chordal cages. They walked into the studio with sketches, not maps. Evans, Coltrane, Adderley. The air was thick with smoke and unsaid things. Seven hours to change music forever. So What. A shrug, a question, a declaration. The sound of rain on a windowpane at 3 AM.",

    title: "Electric Weather",
    subtitle: "Bitches Brew, 1970",
    content: "The acoustic world was too small. He plugged in. The trumpet screamed through wah-wah pedals, distorted, fragmented. A voodoo soup of funk, rock, and chaos. Purists wept. He didn't care. He was chasing a sound he heard in the static of the modern world. A dark magus conducting a storm.",

    title: "The Silence",
    subtitle: "1975 - 1980",
    content: "The horn went back into the case. The curtains were drawn. Pain in the hips, ghosts in the mind. The world moved on, loud and bright, but he stayed in the dark. Five years of nothing but the hum of the refrigerator and the television's blue glow. Sometimes, silence is the loudest note you can play.",

    subtitle: "The Return",
    content: "He emerged frail, eyes hidden behind oversized glasses. The sound was different now—pop, synth, polished chrome. But the phrasing remained. The ache. He played Michael Jackson, he played Cyndi Lauper. He played Miles. Until the very end, he refused to look back. The only direction was forward.",
